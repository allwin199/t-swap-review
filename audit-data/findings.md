# Protocol Summary


# Disclaimer

Prince Allwin and team makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
|            |        | High   | Medium | Low |
|            | High   | H      | H/M    | M   |
| Likelihood | Medium | H/M    | M      | M/L |
|            | Low    | M      | M/L    | L   |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.

# Findings

## High

## Informational

### [I-1] `PoolFactory::PoolFactory__PoolDoesNotExist` is not used and should be removed.

```diff
-   error PoolFactory__PoolDoesNotExist(address tokenAddress);
```

### [I-2] Lacking zero address checks

```diff
    constructor(address wethToken) {
+       if(wethToken == address(0)){
+          revert();
+       }
        i_wethToken = wethToken;
    }

```

### [I-3] `PoolFactory::createPool` should use `symbol()` instead of `name()`

```diff
- string memory liquidityTokenSymbol = string.concat("ts", IERC20(tokenAddress).name());
+ string memory liquidityTokenSymbol = string.concat("ts", IERC20(tokenAddress).symbol());
```
